Final project for Spring 2013 iOS Programming

This iOS application aimed to make life slightly easier for the researcher who frequently uses antibodies. Several features
such as electing to use a small local database (no signal in Faraday Cages) were implemented with that in mind. 

The application allows the user to search the small local database of antibodies we have by name from the start screen. 
This will push you to an additionl view in which the results are displayed (note you need an exact name match). From here
you can further refine your search on other parameters such as Manufacturer, Origin Species, etc. Selecting the antibody
will push you to the Manufacturer's website for that specific website in a UIWebView. You also have the option from the 
home page to explore the full local database and from the result/discover UITableView you can add antibodies to another
small local database to manage the antibodies in your lab.
